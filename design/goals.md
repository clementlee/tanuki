# Things I hate about Pandas

- Indexes. Everyone gets confused about indices. Indexes should just be a column
- Things get cast whenever however.
- Some things should be lazy, or are better expressed in that way
- Multicore performance is miserable

## But also good things

- Everything has interop (numpy, numba, lots of libraries)
